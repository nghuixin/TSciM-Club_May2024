### Brain Age Prediction Model
Implementation of a s4-layer neural network designed to predict brain age from synthetic input features. We use the covariance matrix to preserve the relationships between features and target variable `Age at Visit` during generation of data. 

### Interpretability Methods
We implement several interpretability methods from the Captum library
